Patches 1-4 represent my quick dialing up of several chorus sounds which are pleasing to me.\n\nThe Power block can be placed after a Pot control to change its curve or "taper". Using increasing powers causes the controlled effect to come in "later" in the pot\'s rotation. Use increasing powers with "invert" and "flip" both set in the control panel to make the effect come in "sooner". Even when you are using a single control, you can process it differently for each destination if that\'s what you want. This allows you to fine-tune the sonic blend all along the rotation of the control pot.\n\nOpen up the control panels and adjust the sounds to your own tastes. Thousands of subtle and not- so-subtle variations are possible.\n\nThere is a tradeoff required between LFO width and LFO speed unless you are looking for sci-fi sounds. Many of the patches use a single control which turns the speed up while turning the width down to achieve a wide range of acceptable chorus sounds with a single control. This is less flexible than using separate controls, but it\'s entirely up to you.\nIn addition, the longer the chorus delay time, the less width you need to achieve a given level of detuning.'}}]},{name:"Delay with threshold",author:"Digital Larry",categories:["Delay"],download:{spcd:{file:"holy-city-audio/delay-with-threshold.spcd"}},source_url:"https://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=123725.0"},{name:"Delay: Bank of demo patches",author:"Digital Larry",categories:["Delay"],download:{spbk:{file:"holy-city-audio/demo-delays.spbk"}},source_url:"https://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=123725.0"},{name:"Filter tremolo",description:"We have both filter tremolo and volume modulation with LFO 90 degrees phase shifted.

Harmonic tremolos may use separate filters for the high and low sections, whereas this implementation uses the high and low outputs of a single state variable filter. You could of course add a second filter so that the corner frequencies could be controlled independently. Also I'm pretty sure that harmonic tremolo varies the high and low amplitude 180 degrees out of phase with each other. This may be a better sound than having them 90 degrees apart.

It uses a drum which is insulating but has a conductive outer surface. It runs through a reservoir of oil and a brush contact connected to a voltage amplifier from the input writes electrons onto the surface which are picked up by another brush on the other side of the drum. So the delay time is related to the angular displacement of the brushes and the RPM. For example if the brushes are 180 degrees apart, and it's going 60 RPM (1 rev/second) then that is a 500 msec delay. t (seconds) = (angle/360) * 60/RPM = angle / (6 * RPM). Faster the RPM, the shorter the delay.\n\nNext there is a wobble (LFO chorus) due to the drum being off center. The rate of this corresponds to the RPM or revs per second. Faster the RPM, the faster the chorus LFO.\n\nSo we need an inverse relationship between chorus rate and delay time from one pot which controls the delay time setting. This you can see from the inverted scale going to the chorus block lfo rate input from pot1 which also goes through a smoother. The net effect of changing the scale/offset blocks (or the delay max time, or the chorus LFO max rate) is to change the angular displacement of the read and write brushes. If the specifics are important, figure it out but you can get different sounds by changing these ratios. Interestingly, the \"size\" of the drum makes no difference.\n\nI used the multi-tap delay block because supposedly some oil can delays had two heads, but I'm not sure.\n\nPot0 = delay time/lfo rate (limited range setting, try making it longer if you like)\nPot1 = chorus width\nPot2 = feedback"}},{written_by:"Mark S.",comments:{text:"This sounds really nice, and takes on a very 'rubbery' sound to it when you crank up the chorus width"}}]},{name:"Percussion Ambience",author:"Digital Larry",description:"Try this on some percussive material.",categories:["Code snippet"],download:{spn:{file:"holy-city-audio/percussion-ambience.spn"}},source_url:"https://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=123725.0"},{name:"Room reverb: 3-4-5",author:"Digital Larry",description:"This one uses 3 delay lines with relative lengths in a ratio of 3 - 4 - 5",categories:["Reverb"],download:{spn:{file:"holy-city-audio/room-reverb-3-4-5.spn"}},source_url:"https://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=123725.0",commentary:[{written_by:"Digital Larry",comments:{text:"This one uses 3 delay lines with relative lengths in a ratio of 3 - 4 - 5 which I just learned is considered a good ratio for such things.

But for octave-up, the fast ramp (16384) results in an unpleasant warble.\n;We can\'t use a longer delay than 4096, so we are stuck with it, right?\n\n;Here is a trick I just came up with: Do two pitch shifts in a row, each shifting up by the square root of two.\n;The magic ramp speed is 6783. Voila, an octave up with a pleasing tremolo instead of the warble.\n;It requires another 4096 memory and 8 instructions, but still only 1 ramp (so you can still use the other for octave down, etc).\n\n;Yes, the tradeoff is latency. In the application I am working on I am going for more of a chorus effect - i.e. multiple instruments rather than a single instrument like a 12-string.\n\n;Notice that I write 512 words into the 4096-word delay. This reduces the latency by that amount.\n;The reason you can do this is that the crossfade waveform is zero for the first 1/8th of the delay. If you try a 2048 word delay you will have to change the "wra delay1+512,0" to "wra delay1+256, 0" in both places. This is probably why it sounded worse than the standard single-step 4096 algorithm.\n\n;Frank commented in an older thread that this trick of writing 1/8th of the way into the buffer shouldn\'t work.\n;I assure you (and Frank) that does. It is totally glitchless, and reduces the average latency by 1/4 for free. I don\'t think Frank considered it carefully.\n  '}}]},{name:"Minimal Reverb - no controls",categories:["Reverb","Code snippet"],download:{spn:{file:"min_rev1.spn"}},controls:["-","-","-"]},{name:"7-Band Parametric EQ",categories:["Code snippet"],download:{spn:{file:"parametric-eq-7.spn"}},application:"Code snippet"},{name:"Slow Gear",author:"patb, Don Stavely",categories:["Uncategorized"],controls:["Attack rate","-","-"],download:{spn:{file:"slowgear-2.spn"}},source_url:"http://www.spinsemi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=174"},{name:"Slow Gear (simple)",author:"Alex MAK",categories:["Uncategorized"],download:{spn:{file:"slowgear-simple.spn"}},source_url:"http://www.spinsemi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=174"},{name:"Thru Gain",categories:["Code snippet"],download:{spn:{file:"thru-gain.spn"}},application:"Code snippet"},{name:"Tremolo w/ Multiple LFO Waveshapes",author:"Slacker",categories:["Tremolo"],download:{spn:{file:"tremolo-shapes.spn"}},controls:["Wave shape","Depth","Speed"],source_url:"http://www.spinsemi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=516",commentary:[{written_by:"Slacker",comments:{text:"If anyone's interested here's a tremolo I did using pot skip routines to do Sine, rectified sine both ways so pointy or humpy :) up and down ramps, triangle, trapezoid and square.
